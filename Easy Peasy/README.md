#Easy Peasy 

This was not so easy one, on running it this appear

![run](pics/run.png)

on entering random flag it terminates

putting in **ida_pro** and search for this **"Enter The Flag"** and sit break point there

![breakpoint](pics/flag.png) 

the first step after entring the flag is counting it's characters and compare them with **26** if they are more or less the program ends
if they are 26 then the Check starts

![check](pics/check.png)

this loop easly make some masking to the bits to swap the least significant two bits then it compare with **eax** which stores the desired value

now you only need to debug the program with any debugger, you can use **x64dbg**, Icontenued with **ida** 
the next step is just to patch the **jnz** to **jz** and enter any 26 flag 
then make another breakpoint at this jump and check the eax value 
then easly you swap the most right two bits to get 
**[46 c4 41 47 7b 43 50 50 5f 31 53 5f 43 30 39 6c f5 32 34 35 32 37 34 35 36 7d]**
translating this hex to assci you get 
**"FLAG{CPP_1S_C00l_24527456}"**
but this not the flag form so the flag is 
**0xL4ugh{CPP_1S_C00l_24527456}**
